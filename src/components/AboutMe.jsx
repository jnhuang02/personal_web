        <p>Hello, my name is Justin, an upcoming masters student at UCLA pursuing a master degree in applied statistics and data science.
                  I did my undergraduate at UCSD with a bachelor's in Math-Computer Science along with a minor in Data Science and Busisness - Economics.
                In my spare time, I like to stay active by lifting weights, running, swimming, and playing basketball with friends. I am also expanding my music poweress how
             to DJ and learn how to play the guitar.</p>

                Outside of my hobbies, I worked as an instructional assistant for calculus 1 and Vector Calculus at UCSD during my time in undergraduate.  I hosted my own office hours, assisted students at discussion
                sections, and graded tests and homework assignments. I was also a proctor for the Triton Testing Center, where I monitered students and upheld the academic integrity standards on campus.

                I enjoy front-end development, while at the same time having a keen interest in machine learning and data. I believe that data is another way to tell stories, and 
                deciphering the meaning behind data can greatly contribute to technological advancements and drive society forward.
